# Tizzy (Mobile Application)

Tizzy will serve as a mediator between the Banglejs watches, and the server, primarily with the following roles:

- Sending health data to the server, and back.
- Facilitating the use of Tempo.

Tizzy (Mobile Application) will be developed using Flutter, primarily for the android device.

The app will have a list of menu options, corresponding to the apps on the watch that it supports.
Communication between the watches, and the apps will be done using intents as laid out [here](https://www.espruino.com/Gadgetbridge).

The apps that will be supported are:

- Tempo
- ISeeYou

Tizzy will also provide access to a simple chat interface called TizzChat.

The wireframe for this project is located in the `wireframe.png` image located in this folder.
More information will be provided in `./tizzy_watch/README.md`.
